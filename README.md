# Multi-label_Classification
This project focuses on solving a multi-class and multi-label classification problem using the binary relevance classifier approach and SVM models trained using Gaussian kernels and one versus all classifiers. The project also involves evaluating the classifiers using exact match and hamming score/loss methods, implementing L1-penalized SVMs and SMOTE for class imbalance correction. Additional practice involves studying the Classifier Chain method and computing performance metrics for the classifiers.
